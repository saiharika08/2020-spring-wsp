I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s program in Computer Science in SUNY NEW PALTZ.
I have completed my undergraduate in Computer Science in India. 
I had done my specialization in Networking, which was provided by our college, K L UNIVERSITY. 
My major and minor projects were related to computer networks and I had also submitted a thesis on Black Hole Attack in networks. 


I am always interested in Networking and I studied and worked on it for a quite good time, 
but apart from that the next course I am mostly interested in is, 
Web Server Programming which is why I have chosen this course and I want to excel in this as well. 
I see myself as a good web server programmer, programming web pages, 
debugging the problems on the web and try to create a good web page on my own after completing this course.                


Thank you.
